A group of Italian developers is planning three million square feet of retail
construction, plus 2,200 homes, in Tusayan, a newly incorporated village with a
population of just 587 at the entrance to the park, posing what park officials
describe as a major threat to the water supply for the Colorado River. A
skywalk finished in 2007 over the western rim of the Grand Canyon, on land
owned by the Hualapai tribe, has become an overwhelming success, drawing
thousands of visitors a year, most from Las Vegas. Some then take a helicopter
ride to the bottom of the canyon, to the distress of conservationists.
