Epilepsy is a devastating neurological condition characterized by the occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures and is often comorbid with cognitive deficits. A significant problem with epilepsy is that in 30% of cases the seizures are drug-resistant. Thus, to impact therapy, it is critical to find direct approaches targeting the mechanisms driving epilepsy instead of just suppressing the seizures. We seek to identify, study, and understand mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of epilepsy and potentially serve as therapeutic targets; thereby contributing to the prevention, treatment, and control of epilepsy.  Specifically, our research focuses on determining the role of microglia and associated phagocytic and inflammatory signaling cascades in the neuropathology and pathophysiology (seizures and memory deficits) of epilepsy.
