The site is hosted in github and uses a few online tools do facilitate
content generation and publication:

- wercker:

Monitors the github repo and performs actions when changes occur.
Look at the yml configuration for more details.

- prose.io:

This is a web wrapper to the repo. Very convenient for non-technical people
so they can focus on the content.
