name_code: Introduction to Behavioral Neuroscience
desc: 'This course explores the fundamental associations between brain structures and the modulation of behavior at the cellular and systems levels. Students learn about how brain cells use biochemical signals (i.e., neurotransmitters, hormones) to communicate with each other to ultimately regulate higher level functions such as sensory functions (vision, taste, touch, smell, and hearing), learning, memory, hunger, eating, sex, sleep, language, and emotions, among others. Students also learn about how certain disruptions of neuronal communication are associated to abnormal behaviors such as drug addiction and psychiatric disorders. '
