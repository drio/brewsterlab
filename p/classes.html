            <div class="class-description">Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques and neuropharmacology allow for the unprecedented visualization and manipulation of the human mind. These technologies are often developed with the goal of helping to improve the diagnosis and treatment of human medical diseases and conditions. Nowadays, the use of brain imaging and “mind drugs” has made it into legal and social systems, such as courtrooms and classrooms. The “off label” use of these technologies comes with numerous ethical issues related to safety, responsibility, fairness, risks, benefits, free will, and privacy, among others. In this course we discuss cases in which brain imaging technology and pharmacological treatments have been used in an attempt to predict and to manipulate human behaviors.</div>

            <div class="class-description">This course explores the neurobiological basis of disorders of the nervous system and psychiatric disease. We cover various neurological disorders that affect behavior along with the associated cellular and molecular mechanisms. Some examples include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. We cover their history, from their discovery or first description, the etiology, pathology, prognosis, and treatment strategies. The world population affected with neurological disorders, the global categorization, and the globalization of mental illness are discussed.</div>

            <div class="class-description">This course covers the fundamental associations between brain structures and the modulation of behavior at the cellular and systems levels. Students learn about how brain cells use biochemical signals (i.e., neurotransmitters, hormones) to communicate with each other and to ultimately regulate higher level functions such as sensory functions (vision, taste, touch, smell, and hearing), learning, memory, hunger, eating, sex, sleep, language, and emotions. Students also learn about how certain disruptions of neuronal communication are associated with abnormal behaviors such as drug addiction and psychiatric disorders.</div>
