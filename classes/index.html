    <span class="class-id">PSY222:</span>
    <span class="class-name">Introduction to Behavioral Neuroscience</span>
  </div>
  <div class="class-description"> This course explores the fundamental associations between brain structures and the modulation of behavior at the cellular and systems levels. Students learn about how brain cells use biochemical signals (i.e., neurotransmitters, hormones) to communicate with each other to ultimately regulate higher level functions such as sensory functions (vision, taste, touch, smell, and hearing), learning, memory, hunger, eating, sex, sleep, language, and emotions, among others. Students also learn about how certain disruptions of neuronal communication are associated to abnormal behaviors such as drug addiction and psychiatric disorders.</div>

    <span class="class-id">PSY392:</span>
    <span class="class-name">Neurobiology of Disease</span>
  </div>
  <div class="class-description"> This course explores the neurobiological basis of disorders of the nervous system and psychiatric disease. We cover various neurological disorders that affect behavior, the associated cellular and molecular mechanisms, and current treatment strategies. Some examples include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Epilepsy, Stroke, and Traumatic Brain injury among others. We cover the history of each of these neurological disorders; their discovery or first description, the etiology, pathology, prognosis, the most advanced treatments currently available, and the scientists credited for the work. The world population affected with neurological disorders, the categorization in different countries as compared to the USA, and the globalization of mental illness is discussed. </div>

    <span class="class-id">PSY591:</span>
    <span class="class-name">Neuroethics</span>
  </div>
  <div class="class-description"> Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques and neuropharmacology allow for the unprecedented visualization and manipulation of the human mind. These technologies are often developed with the goal of helping to improve the diagnosis and treatment of human medical diseases and conditions. Nowadays, the use of brain imaging and “mind drugs” has made it into legal and social systems, such as courtrooms and classrooms. The “off label” use of these technologies comes with numerous ethical issues related to safety, responsibility, fairness, risks, benefits, free will, and privacy, among others. We will discuss cases in which brain imaging technology and pharmacological treatments have been used in an attempt to predict human behaviors and to influence/and manipulate individuals. </div>
